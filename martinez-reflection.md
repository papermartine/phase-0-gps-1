## Katie M's Reflections from GPS 1.1

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

The order of git workflow was sometimes confusing for me when it came to merge vs. git origin pull branchname.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The above was really clarified! Especially when we added the fetch command.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

A question that turned out to have a really simple answer was why my feature branches were appearing above AND below the master branch (they are alpha). Also, I was confused when we created a new repo and the first doc was immediately pushed back to origin, rather than going on a feature branch. 

* What still confuses you about Git?

Hmmm, I'm feeling pretty good right now.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was awesome! Our instructor Aji was super nice and helpful. The pairing sessions are a fun way to go through challenges and I am going to get SO much experience working with different personalities.
